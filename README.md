#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/836Ol6z68L4?si=eDksBeP5zIBEO0Nq
#### Description:

## Overview
A Flask web app that allows users to search, rate, and receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Features
- User authentication (register/login)
- TMDb-powered search
- Rate movies (1–5 stars)
- View your rated list
- Genre-based recommendations
- Trending/most-rated movies
- Cinematic dark theme

## Project Overview
Movie Recommender is a full-stack web application built with Flask, SQLite, Jinja2, and the TMDb API, designed to help users discover, rate, and get recommendations for movies tailored to their tastes.

Inspired by modern streaming platforms, the app offers a sleek, cinematic interface where users can:

🔍 Search for any movie using TMDb

⭐ Rate and review movies they’ve watched

🧠 Receive personalized recommendations based on their highest-rated genres

📊 View their personal ratings history

🔥 Browse trending movies among all users

🎞️ Watch featured trailers

🔐 Securely register, log in, and manage their experience

The app is fully responsive, visually engaging, and hosted live using Render, bringing a professional, movie-themed user experience to life.

## File Breakdown
📁 /app.py
This is the main Flask application that handles all routes, user logic, database operations, session management, and API integration.

Key routes include:

/register – Allows users to create an account

/login – Authenticates user sessions

/logout – Clears session data

/search – Lets users search for movies via the TMDb API

/rate – Accepts and stores ratings into the SQLite database

/recommend – Displays movie recommendations based on user preferences

/ratings – Lists movies rated by the logged-in user

/trending – Shows the most-rated movies across the app

📁 /templates/
Contains all Jinja2 HTML templates used to render the pages dynamically.

layout.html – Base layout extended by all other templates. Includes the navbar, footer, hero banner, trailer modal, and common scripts/styles.

index.html – Homepage with a parallax hero section and CTA buttons.

login.html, register.html – Forms for user authentication.

search.html – Displays search results from the TMDb API.

recommend.html – Shows personalized movie suggestions.

ratings.html – Lists the user’s rated movies.

trending.html – Highlights popular movies based on ratings by all users.

📁 /static/
Stores custom CSS and media assets.

styles.css – Custom styling for the dark movie theme, cards, buttons, and responsive layout. Includes parallax banner, play button styles, and input field formatting.

hero.jpg – A high-resolution cinematic banner image used on the homepage.

favicon.png – A small browser icon to brand the application.

📁 /helpers.py
Contains utility functions like:

lookup(title) – Queries TMDb API for search results or details.

login_required() – Decorator to protect routes from unauthorized access.

📁 /movies.db
SQLite3 database storing user credentials and movie ratings.

users table – Stores username, hashed password

ratings table – Maps user_id, movie_id, title, and rating

## Design & Technical Decisions
User Ratings & Recommendations:
Ratings are stored per user, and recommendations are generated by analyzing the genres of their top-rated films. The decision to use genre-based filtering rather than collaborative filtering was made to ensure personalization without requiring a large dataset of users.

TMDb API Integration:
Instead of scraping or hardcoding movies, TMDb provides rich movie data with genres, posters, and trailers. I used its /search, /movie, and /discover endpoints. I considered OMDb, but TMDb provided cleaner poster URLs and genre data.

Cinematic Design Language:
I opted for a dark UI to reflect the look and feel of a theater or streaming platform. Fonts like Cinzel and Montserrat, golden button accents, and a trailer overlay add to the immersive feel.

Parallax Hero Banner:
The homepage uses a background-attachment: fixed banner to create a depth illusion. It introduces users with a strong visual identity and includes a YouTube play button that opens a trailer modal.

Session Management:
Sessions are stored securely using Flask’s built-in session tools. The login_required() decorator protects all user-specific routes, keeping data private.


## What I Learned
Working with real-world APIs and authenticating securely

Structuring a scalable Flask app

Managing templates and static assets cleanly

Deploying a live web app with session protection

Writing clean, styled HTML with Bootstrap and custom CSS

The importance of clear, user-friendly UI design

## Conclusion
This project was both technically challenging and creatively fulfilling. I learned to blend backend logic with frontend design, to work with third-party APIs, and to consider user experience as much as functionality.

It’s a project I’m proud to showcase — thank you to the CS50 staff and community for this incredible course.
